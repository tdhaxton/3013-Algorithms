# BSTvAVL - Balanced vs Unbalanced
## This program will implement a simple binary tree data structure with operations for insertion, deletion, and searching
## Additionally, it will implement a balanced AVL tree data structure with the same operations
## Random datasets will be generated and a sweries of insertions, deletions, and searches will be performed on both trees using the same datasets.
## Build cost, execution times, and number of comparisons will be measured and compared
## Performance of the unbalanced and the balanced trees will be analyzed and compared for various operations.
